7.4. Experiment Web Application

During this project, you've made informative data visualizations, built helpful Python classes, and conducted statistical analyses. In this lesson, you're going to combine all of those elements into a single, interactive web application.

This web application will be similar to the one you built in Project 6 because it will also have a three-tier architecture. But instead of writing our code in a notebook, this time we'll use .py files, like we did in Project 5.

This notebook has the instructions and videos for the tasks you need to complete. You'll also launch your application from here. But all the coding will be in the files: display.py, business.py, and database.py.

Warning: The database has changed since this videos for this lesson were filmed. So don't worry if you don't get exactly the same numbers as the instructor for the tasks in this project.

Warning: If you have issues with your app launching during this project, try restarting your kernel and re-running the notebook from the beginning. Go to Kernel > Restart Kernel and Clear All Outputs.

If that doesn't work, close the browser window for your virtual machine, and then relaunch it from the "Overview" section of the WQU learning platform.

1. Application Layout
We're going to build our application using a three-tier architecture. The three .py files ‚Äî or modules ‚Äî represent the three layers of our application. We'll start with our display layer, where we'll keep all the elements that our user will see and interact with.

VimeoVideo("741483369", h="169cf24bb2", width=600)
Task 7.4.1: In the display module, instantiate a JupyterDash application named app. Then begin building its layout by adding three H1 headers with the titles: "Applicant Demographics", "Experiment", and "Results".

You can test this task by restarting your kernel and running the first cell in this notebook. ‚òùÔ∏è

2. Demographic Charts
The first element in our application is the "Applicant Demographics" section. We'll start by building a drop-down menu that will allow the user to select which visualization they want to see.

VimeoVideo("741483344", h="96b0bc2215", width=600)
Task 7.4.2: Add a drop-down menu to the "Applicant Demographics" section of your layout. It should have three options: "Nationality", "Age", and "Education". Be sure to give it the ID "demo-plots-dropdown".

You can test this task by restarting your kernel and running the first cell in this notebook. ‚òùÔ∏è

VimeoVideo("741483308", h="71b4f8853f", width=600)
Task 7.4.3: Add a Div object below your drop-down menu. Give it the ID "demo-plots-display".

Nothing to test for now. Go to the next task. üòÅ

VimeoVideo("741483291", h="7f5953609c", width=600)
Task 7.4.4: Complete the display_demo_graph function in the display module. It should take input from "demo-plots-dropdown" and pass output to "demo-plots-display". For now, it should only return an empty Graph object. We'll add to it in later tasks.

You can test this task by restarting your kernel and running the first cell in this notebook. ‚òùÔ∏è

Now that we have the interactive elements needed for our demographic charts, we need to create the components that will retrieve the data for those charts. That means we need to move to the database layer. We'll start by creating the class and method for our choropleth visualization.

VimeoVideo("741483275", h="478958c636", width=600)
Task 7.4.5: In the database module, create a MongoRepository class. Build your __init__ method using the docstring as a guide. To test your work, restart your kernel and rerun the cell below.üëá

What's a class?
Write a class method in Python.
What's a choropleth map?
from database import MongoRepository
from pymongo.collection import Collection
‚Äã
repo = MongoRepository()
‚Äã
# Is `MongoRepository.collection` correct type?
assert isinstance(repo.collection, Collection)
‚Äã
# Is repo connected to correct collection?
collection_name = repo.collection.name
assert collection_name == "ds-applicants"
‚Äã
print("repo collection:", collection_name)
VimeoVideo("741485132", h="b8e0fefe63", width=600)
Task 7.4.6: Working with the code you wrote in Lesson 7.1, create a get_nationality_value_counts method for your MongoRepository. Use the docstring as a guide. To test your work, restart your kernel and run the cell below.üëá

Write a class definition in Python.
Write a class method in Python.
import pandas as pd
from database import MongoRepository
‚Äã
repo = MongoRepository()
‚Äã
# Does `MongoRepository.get_nationality_value_counts` return DataFrame?
df = repo.get_nationality_value_counts(normalize=False)
assert isinstance(df, pd.DataFrame)
‚Äã
# Does DataFrame have correct columns?
cols = sorted(df.columns.tolist())
assert cols == ["count", "country_iso2", "country_iso3", "country_name"]
df.head()
OK! We've got the interactive display. We've got the data. It's time to build out the business layer components for our choropleth visualization.

VimeoVideo("741485104", h="e799311d01", width=600)
Task 7.4.7: In the business module, create a GraphBuilder class. For now, it should have two methods: __init__ and build_nat_choropleth. For the former, use the docstring as a guide. For the latter, use your code from Lesson 7.1. To test your work, restart your kernel and run the cell below.üëá

Write a class definition in Python.
Write a class method in Python.
from business import GraphBuilder
from plotly.graph_objects import Figure
‚Äã
gb = GraphBuilder()
‚Äã
# Does `GraphBuilder.build_nat_choropleth` return a Figure?
fig = gb.build_nat_choropleth()
assert isinstance(fig, Figure)
fig.show()
Last step for our choropleth: Connecting the business and display layers.

VimeoVideo("741485088", h="db9f1ef285", width=600)
Task 7.4.8: Add to your display_demo_graph function in the display module so that it uses a GraphBuilder to construct a choropleth map when "demo-plots-dropdown" is set to "Nationality".

Our visualization is looking good! Now we'll repeat the process for our age histogram, adding the necessary components to each of our three layers.

VimeoVideo("741485077", h="df549867f8", width=600)
Task 7.4.9: Repeat the process from the previous three tasks, now for the "Age" histogram. This means you'll need to add a get_ages method to your MongoRepository, a build_age_hist method to your GraphBuilder, and adjust your display_demo_graph function in the display module. To test your work, restart your kernel and run the cells below.üëá

Write a class method in Python.
Create a histogram using plotly express.
import pandas as pd
from database import MongoRepository
‚Äã
repo = MongoRepository()
# Does `MongoRepository.get_ages` return a Series?
ages = repo.get_ages()
assert isinstance(ages, pd.Series)
ages.head()
from business import GraphBuilder
from plotly.graph_objects import Figure
‚Äã
gb = GraphBuilder()
‚Äã
# Does `GraphBuilder.build_nat_choropleth` return a Figure?
fig = gb.build_age_hist()
assert isinstance(fig, Figure)
fig.show()
One last test: Restart your kernel and run the first cell in this notebook. ‚òùÔ∏è

Two down, one to go. Time for the education bar chart.

VimeoVideo("741485030", h="110532eb64", width=600)
Task 7.4.10: Repeat the process, now for the "Education" bar chart. You'll need to add a get_ed_value_counts method to your MongoRepository, a build_ed_bar method to your GraphBuilder, and adjust your display_demo_graph function in the display module. To test your work, restart your kernel and run the cells below.üëá

Write a class method in Python.
Create a bar chart using plotly express.
import pandas as pd
from database import MongoRepository
‚Äã
# Test  method
repo = MongoRepository()
‚Äã
# Does `MongoRepository.get_ed_value_counts` return a Series?
degrees = repo.get_ed_value_counts(normalize=False)
assert isinstance(degrees, pd.Series)
‚Äã
# Is Series index ordered correctly?
assert degrees.index.tolist() == [
    "High School or Baccalaureate",
    "Some College (1-3 years)",
    "Bachelor's degree",
    "Master's degree",
    "Doctorate (e.g. PhD)",
]

assert isinstance(fig, Figure)
fig.show()
One last test: Restart your kernel and run the first cell in this notebook. ‚òùÔ∏è

3. Experiment
The "Experiment" section of our application will have two elements: A slider that will allow the user to select the effect size they want to detect, and another slider for the number of days they want the experiment to run.

3.1. Effect Size Slider
Our effect size slider will need components in the display and business layers.

VimeoVideo("741488949", h="3162fd9d7b", width=600)
Task 7.4.11: Add a Slider object to the "Experiment" section of your app layout, followed by a Div object. Their IDs should be "effect-size-slider" and "effect-size-display", respectively.

VimeoVideo("741488859", h="ed4cc1bd83", width=600)
Task 7.4.16: Create a display_cdf_pct function in the display module. It should take input from "experiment-days-slider" and "effect-size-slider", and pass output to the "experiment-days-display".

One last test: Restart your kernel and run the first cell in this notebook. ‚òùÔ∏è

4. Results
Last section! For our "Results", we'll start with a button in the display layer. When the user presses it, the experiment will be run for the number of days specified by the experiment duration slider.

VimeoVideo("741488845", h="8eac1ff22d", width=600)

docs_after_exp = mr.collection.count_documents({})
assert docs_after_exp > docs_before_exp
‚Äã

print("Documents added to database:", docs_after_exp - docs_before_exp)
Of course, our user needs to see the results of their experiment. We'll start with a side-by-side bar chart for our contingency table. Again, we'll need to add components to our business and database layers.

VimeoVideo("741488782", h="f5aebc850f", width=600)
Task 7.4.20: Add a build_contingency_bar method to your GraphBuilder class, and then incorporate it into your display_results function. In order for this to work, you'll also need to create a get_contingency_table method for your MongoRepository class.
